# DodgeAsteroid  Android Game

Simple android game where you tilt your screen up and down to move your ship to dodge asteroids.


## TODO:

Document code

Better art (Blue Triangle vs Gray Circles of Doom)

Game does not work if phone is facing straight down due to angle values going from -180 to 180.



Possible improvements

Variable acceleration depending on tilt

Menu screen

Multiplayer? (super ambitious)
